**Should Do:**

-------------------------------------------

Change EDHRandomizer site to use vercel backend, maybe that would let us do more fun stuff?


**Randomizer Powerups:**

Maybe roll 2 of these?

* Rerolls / Pick from bigger selection of commanders

  Common:      +1 Commanders to pick from
  Uncommon:    +2 Commanders to pick from
  Rare: 	     +3 Commanders to pick from
  Mythic:      +4 Commanders to pick from
  
* Get more popular commanders

  Common:    
  Uncommon:  TBD
  Rare:      
  Mythic:    
  
* Color filtering with different tier rarities:

  Common:    restrict a color from pool
  Uncommon:  pick 1 color to include
  Rare:      pick 2 colors to include
  Mythic:    pick exactly which colors
  
* Partner commanders:

  Rare:   Partner with a commander that matches within color identity
  Mythic: Partner with any commander, can even expand color identity

* Template:

  Mythic: Sharpie text off of your commander, must be a contiguous line going only from adjacent words.
          Locking card in TTS lets you draw on them btw

* Template:

  Common:  
  Uncommon:  
  Rare:  
  Mythic:

**Drafting Powerups:**

* Signature Spell

  Mythic: Instant/sorcery in the command zone, can recast with separate commander tax (like oathbreaker)

* Extra packs

  Rare: Start with 1 extra pack

* Upgrade bracket

  Rare:   One pack gets upgraded to bracket 3
  Mythic: One pack gets upgraded to bracket 4

* Upgrade budget - Default packs are 1 Expensive, 11 budget, and 3 lands
  
  Common:   Replace budget cards in 1 of your packs with Anys
  Uncommon: Replace budget cards in 2 of your packs with Anys
  Rare:     1 of your packs becomes fully expensive cards
  Mythic:   2 of your packs become fully expensive cards

* Game Changer Pack:

  Rare: Random game changer
  Mythic: Pack has 3 game changers, you pick 1

* Conspiracy Pack:

  Common: Random conspiracy
  Uncommon: Pack has 3 cards, pick 1 from it
  Rare: Pack has 6 cards, pick 1 from it
  Mythic: Pack has 10 cards, pick 2 from it, can use 2 conspiracies this game
  
* Banned Pack:

  Rare: Get random banned card
  Mythic: Pack has 3, pick 1 

* Upgrade Manabase:

  Uncommon: Get expensive land pack, maybe true/og duals

**Some other ideas:**

- Start with Jeweled Lotus if your commander high CMC
- Start with a treasure
- Start with Chromatic Lantern, but go last
- ...



**Lower Priority:**

-------------------------------------


Custom Pack Textures, different ones for EDHRec / Moxfield / Scryfall. And maybe some extras for certain packs like 'ScangTech' or 'Anti-Jp Tech'

Partner any 2 commanders and somehow get EDHRecs for them?


Get packs for specific EDHRec deck tag filters eg: Blink, Planeswalkers, Artifacts, etc







**Probably wont do:**
